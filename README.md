# ACL

Artem's Classes/Components/Controls library (ACL).


Library contains number of classes, components and visual controls for Delphi that used in [AIMP](https://www.aimp.ru).
I have published the library because it was used in plugins that no longer supported by me.


If anyone will be interested the library I will add more details and create index of all features and abilities of the library.
My working Delphi is 11.0 Alexandria. The library may work on earlier versions of Delphi, but I haven't tested it.
