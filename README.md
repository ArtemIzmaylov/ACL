# ACL

Artem's Classes/Components/Controls library (ACL).


Library contains number of classes, components and visual controls for Delphi that used in [AIMP](https://www.aimp.ru).
I have published the library because it was used in plugins that no longer supported by me.


If anyone will be interested the library I will add more details and create index of all features and abilities of the library. My main versions of Delphi is 11.3 / 12.2. The library may work with earlier versions of Delphi, but I have not tested it.
